    <h3>New Zealand Reelects Prime Minister</h3>

    <h4>Jacinda Ardern is the popular prime minister of New Zealand.<br> On October 17, she proved her popularity once again during her reelection.
    </h4>
    <p style ="margin-top:45px">Overall, Ardern and her Labour Party won 49 percent of the vote. This was significantly more than any of her opponents.
    </p>
    The <strong>historic landslide </strong>was a reflection of Ardern’s achievements. New Zealand first elected her in 2017. Since then, the 40-year-old leader has led the country through numerous crises.

    <p><u>Ardern</u> particularly received praise this year for her swift response to the coronavirus. In the past, she ably dealt with domestic terror attacks and natural disasters.
    Meanwhile, the Labour Party won 64 parliamentary seats through the election. Therefore, Ardern and her party will be in a strong position to lead in the coming years.
